A simple MacOS desktop application designed to make you more efficient with your screen shots. Like the new option that pops up on your iPhone when you take a screenshot, but for desktop.

2. Unzip it (it's safe)
3. Right click on ScreenShit.app and select open

## How to use

1. Click start
2. Take screen shot (CMD + SHIFT + 4)
3. Copy image to clipboard
4. Paste (CMD + V) image into apps like iMessage



## Why?

I made this app because I take lots of screenshots and want a better way to manage it. ScreenShit runs in the background and monitors for new screen shots. When a new screen shot is detected, ScreenShit prompts you with options for handling the screen shot.  I understand apple includes a features like this in the new osx. I've yet to upgrade my OS.
